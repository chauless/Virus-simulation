The Virus Spreading Simulator is an innovative project that uses Java to simulate the spread of a virus within a group of people. Looking at how the pandemic was going, understanding how viruses spread has never been more critical, and my simulator is an indispensable tool for educating people on the impact of viruses and how to prevent their spread.

The Virus Spreading Simulator uses JavaFX framework to create a simulator that shows how virus can spread within a group of people. The program will allow user to change simulation parameters, such as changing the speed at which people move or the speed of spreading the disease. The purpose of the simulation will be to show people how fast a virus can be spread, depending on the parameters you set.

Investing in the Virus Spreading Simulator is investing in the future of public health. By supporting the project, you will be contributing to a crucial effort to create a healthier and safer future for everyone.

# Project goals

The main goal of the project is to provide a visual representation of how a virus can spread in a group of people. The simulator will allow users to change different parameters to see how they affect the spread of the virus. The simulation will also provide information about the number of infected people, the number of recovered and the number of deaths caused by the virus.
